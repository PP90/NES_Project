# NES_Project
Energetic profile and application on air quality in-door project for Networked Embedded Systems, course of Master Degree 
in Computer Engineering in University of Pisa.It consists of a WSN in which a sink and a certain number of pollution nodes
send their sensed values and information about energy consumption to the sink.
Then, the sink computes the energy consumption for each node and stores the information about the pollution data.
The actual version works on Cooja, simulator of Contiki 3.0.
